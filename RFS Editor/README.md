RFS Editor is a simple tool for editing RFS databases.

First open the .xml file describing the DB structure, then load the .db file itself.

Tables can be exported as .txt files, modified using Excel or Open Office Calc and imported back.

The function Change XML is used to modify the structure of the database, this typically makes the database unusable as it requires changes also in the engine RFS.exe. It is reserved for advanced editing.
